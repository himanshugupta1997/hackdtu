health-SMS is a service intended to be used by government health agencies to notify registered citizens about the latest health issues that are relevant to them. The content of these messages is decided on the basis of anonymous healthcare data that is fetched from public hospitals and health centers. A simple deep learning model is used to predict the relevance of a message for a given person.

health-SMS will be able to send extremely focused messages if the dataset for the deep model is large.
